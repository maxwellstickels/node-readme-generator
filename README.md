## Overview

The Node README Generator generates professionally designed READMEs for GitHub projects based off of user input. It requires the user to state their GitHub username and email address, as well as their project's name, function, and usage instructions. There are also optional fields for providing installation instructions, crediting collaborators, explaining tests, adding a license, discussing project features, and detailing how others can contribute to your project.

To avoid overriding this file, files generated by the application will be named README-NEW.md. In addition, the first version of the file will be overwritten if the program is run twice; it is strongly recommended to move your README-NEW.md file to the desired project folder once you have finished using the Node README Generator.

## Programs Used
This program was made in Visual Studio Code 1.56.0 with Javascript and the Node.JS API; it also requires the fs and inquirer libraries, which can be installed using npm.
